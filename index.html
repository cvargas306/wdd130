            <p> My name is Carlos Vargas and I'm from Costa Rica. I enjoy living in a country with many different natural resources such as volcanos, rivers, rainforests, beaches, waterfalls and many more. A peculiarity of Costa Rica is that there's no army, the budget that would have been spent on an army is invested in education. I have a beautiful family, my wife and three daughters. I'm also a musician, 
                I love playing the piano. I'm studyng in BYU-Idaho through BYU-Pathway Worldwide. I'm happy to have this educational opportunity. 
                I hope I can achieve my goals and serve others. It is a new challenge to starting studying a new degree that has not a direct
                relationship with the carrer I studied before, however, I know I can find different points of relationship between technology and arts teaching. I'm learning many interesting concepts in the course WDD 130 Web Fundamentals. I hope to know how to apply what I have learned at the right time. </p>
